# SCODA: A linear streaming algorithm for community detection in very large networks

This repository provides a reference implementation of the streaming community detection algorithm SCoDA
described in the following research paper submitted to an upcomming conference:

**A linear streaming algorithm for community detection in very large networks**, Alexandre Hollocou, Julien Maudet, Thomas Bonald, Marc Lelarge

We provide two implementations of SCoDA:

- a **minimal version** of the code,
which shall be used for practical applications (in the `minimal_code` directory);
- and a **benchmark version** of the code,
which provides additional tools to evaluate the performance of the algorithm
and can be used to reproduce the results of the paper (in the `benchmark_code` directory).
